\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\paragraph{Background and Importance:}

\begin{itemize}
	\color{red}
	\item Boolean Networks (BNs) provide a fundamental framework for modeling complex systems in domains like systems biology and computational logic.
	\item In BN dynamics, fixed points correspond to stable configurations or long-term behaviors (e.g., cell types in gene networks).
	\item Counting all fixed points of a BN is computationally challenging (\#P-complete) yet valuable for understanding system stability and diversity of outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recent Advances:}

\begin{itemize}
	\color{red}
	\item ASP-based Counting: Kabir et al. (CP 2025) introduced an approximate answer set programming method that leverages ASP solving to efficiently estimate the number of fixed points without exhaustive enumeration.
	\item SAT-based Counting: Higuchi et al. (IJCAI 2025) developed a SAT solving approach that encodes BN fixed-point conditions into CNF and uses SAT/model-counting techniques to count all solutions, overcoming limitations of prior BDD and ASP enumeration methods.
\end{itemize}
